FastAPI is a modern, fast (as the name implies), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
It is designed to be easy to use, high-performance, and to provide automatic generation of OpenAPI and JSON Schema documentation.
Some key features of FastAPI include:

Fast: FastAPI is built on top of Starlette and Pydantic, taking advantage of asynchronous programming and type hints to achieve high performance.
It is one of the fastest Python web frameworks available.

Automatic Docs: FastAPI automatically generates OpenAPI and JSON Schema documentation for your API.
This is done based on the type hints in your code, reducing the need for manual documentation.

Type Checking: It leverages Python type hints for request and response validation.
This not only improves the readability of your code but also allows for automatic validation and documentation generation.

Asynchronous Support: FastAPI supports asynchronous programming, making it well-suited for handling a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.

Dependency Injection: It comes with a built-in dependency injection system, making it easy to manage and reuse components in your application.

Security: FastAPI includes security features by default, such as automatic validation of request data, preventing common
security issues like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).




brief comparison of FastAPI with Django and Flask:

Automatic Documentation:
FastAPI automatically generates API documentation, while in Django and Flask, you often need to use additional tools or write documentation manually.

Type Hints and Validation:
FastAPI relies heavily on Python type hints for request and response validation, providing a clear structure to your code.
Django and Flask typically use manual validation or form validation, which may not be as concise.

FastAPI is particularly well-suited for building APIs, microservices, and applications where high performance and automatic documentation are critical.
